üìÑ Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Laba! (Labaku)
Product Name: Laba! (or Labaku)
Version: 1.0 (Full Release)
Owner: Ragil Pamungkas
Platform: Expo (React Native)
Package Manager: Bun

üîñ Overview
Laba! (or Labaku) is a mobile application designed to empower small business owners in tracking their daily product stock movements, monitoring sales (omzet), and calculating profit. This full release version integrates robust user authentication via Supabase, flexible subscription management through RevenueCat (supporting free and premium tiers), and efficient local data persistence using SQLite. The goal is to provide a clean, easy-to-use, and modern minimalist UI that is ready for deployment to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

üéØ Goals
User Management: Enable secure user registration, login, and profile management using Supabase Authentication.

Subscription Tiers: Implement distinct free and premium user tiers, with features gated based on subscription status managed by RevenueCat.

Local Data Persistence: Store all product and transaction data locally on the device using SQLite for offline capability and fast access, managed via Drizzle ORM.

Financial Tracking: Allow users to manage products, record daily "Quantity In" and "Quantity Out", and automatically calculate daily, weekly, and monthly omzet and profit.

Vendor Management: Allow users to define and associate products with specific vendors.

Price History Tracking: Accurately record and utilize historical purchase and selling prices for precise profit calculation over time.

User Experience: Present a clean, easy-to-use UI with a modern minimalist design.

Platform Readiness: Ensure the application is stable, secure, and optimized for release on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

üß± Key Features

1. User Authentication & Profile (Supabase)
   Register Screen: Allows new users to create an account with email and password, utilizing supabase.auth.signUp().

Login Screen: Authenticates existing users with email and password, using supabase.auth.signInWithPassword().

Logout Functionality: Securely logs the user out from both Supabase and RevenueCat.

Profile Screen: Displays user's email (from Supabase) and their current subscription tier (from RevenueCat). Allows for future profile updates (e.g., name).

Secure Session Management: Supabase handles JWTs and session persistence, with expo-secure-store for enhanced security.

2. Subscription Management (RevenueCat)
   Paywall/Upgrade Screen:

Fetches and displays available subscription offerings and packages from RevenueCat (Purchases.getOfferings()).

Presents clear options for free vs. premium tiers (e.g., "Monthly Premium", "Annual Premium").

Initiates in-app purchases using Purchases.purchasePackage().

Includes "Restore Purchases" functionality (Purchases.restorePurchases()).

Entitlement-Based Feature Gating:

The app will check the user's active entitlements from RevenueCat (customerInfo.entitlements.active.pro) to determine premium access.

Features will be conditionally enabled/disabled or prompts to upgrade will be displayed based on the user's subscription status.

User Identification: The Supabase user.id will be used as the appUserID in RevenueCat (Purchases.logIn(supabaseUserId)) to link subscription data to the authenticated user.

3. Dashboard (Home)
   Summary Cards: Displays key financial summaries:

Today‚Äôs Omzet

Today‚Äôs Profit

Weekly Omzet

Monthly Omzet

Data Source: All metrics are calculated from real product and transaction data stored in the local SQLite database.

Tier-Specific Metrics (Premium): Premium users may unlock access to more detailed or historical insights directly on the dashboard (e.g., comparison charts, customizable date ranges).

4. Vendor Management
   Vendor List View: Displays a list of vendors defined by the user.

CRUD Operations:

Add Vendor: Modal form to add new vendor names, persisted to local SQLite via Drizzle ORM.

Edit Vendor: Modal form to modify existing vendor names, updated in local SQLite via Drizzle ORM.

Delete Vendor: Removes a vendor from local SQLite (with a warning if products are linked).

User Scope: Vendors are associated with the logged-in user (userId from Supabase).

5. Product Management
   Product List View: Displays a list of all products with:

Product Name

Associated Vendor

Current Purchase Price (Harga Modal) - derived from latest price history

Current Selling Price (Harga Jual) - derived from latest price history

CRUD Operations:

Add Product: Modal form to add new products. Requires selecting an existing Vendor. Persisted to local SQLite via Drizzle ORM. Initial purchase and selling prices are recorded in the product_price_history table.

Edit Product: Modal form to modify product details (e.g., name, associated vendor).

Price Update: When prices change, a new entry is added to the product_price_history table with the new prices and an effectiveDate (defaulting to today). Existing price history is preserved.

Delete Product: Removes a product and its associated price history and transactions from local SQLite.

User Scope: Products are associated with the logged-in user (userId from Supabase).

Free Tier Limits (Optional): Consider limiting the number of products a free user can manage (e.g., max 10 products) to encourage premium upgrades.

6. Daily Transactions
   Record Transaction: Form to record daily stock movements:

Select Product (from user's product list)

Date (default: today, with option to select past dates)

Quantity In (stock added)

Quantity Out (items sold)

Profit Calculation: Automatically calculates and displays "Profit per entry". This calculation will dynamically retrieve the correct purchasePrice and sellingPrice from the product_price_history table based on the transaction.date.

Data Persistence: All transaction records are saved to the local SQLite database via Drizzle ORM, linked to the userId and productId.

7. Report View
   Filter Options: Allows users to filter omzet and profit reports by:

Daily

Weekly

Monthly

(Premium Feature) Custom Date Range / All Time

Summary Section: Provides total sales and profit for the selected period.

UI: Uses segmented controls or dropdowns for easy filter switching.

Data Source: All reports are generated from transaction data stored in the local SQLite database, utilizing the product_price_history for accurate profit calculation.
